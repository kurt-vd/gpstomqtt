## cross compiling

(Cross-)compiling is performed without using autotools!

Locally modifying the build can be done by creating
a config.mk file, which allows to tune some variables
from the Makefile.

The modifications of config.mk are hidden from git,
they are supposed to be trivial.

Since creating such config.mk file from scratch
may be hard, some examples are provided.
You can start with copying any of those to config.mk

config.mk-arm:
	This cross-compiles on linux (posix) for arm.
